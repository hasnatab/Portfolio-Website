          I am a Web Developer. I am passionate about programming. Solving
          complex IT challenges and turning ideas into reality through coding
          give me an unparalleled sense of joy and accomplishment. Any day, I
          would choose coding over any other work. Besides coding, I am
          interested in sports. I used to play for the Newfoundland provincial
          cricket team and am an avid fan of soccer.

            A professional singer/artist from Bangladesh wants to showcase her
            diverse range of talents and experiences on a personalized website.
            Her goal is to put all her works into an online platform for easy
            accessibility. This website will serve as a versatile portfolio for
            her music and art career simultaneously. Currently a work in
            progress, this project will have two main pages for art and music.
            Copies of her artworks can be viewed and ordered for purchase
            through this website. Her music videos will be presented for viewing
            and clicking them will redirect to the original YouTube videos.

            Evolutionary Algorithm for Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)
          </h3>
          <p>
            The objective of this project was to design and implement an
            Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) for the Traveling Salesman Problem
            (TSP). The population of the project was a list of different random
            tours. Fitness of each tour is the inverse of total distance; the
            lower the total distance the higher the fitness of the tour.
            Different techniques used in this project are: Swap Mutation,
            Ordered Crossover, Tournament Selection or Roulette Wheel for parent
            selection, and ‘(µ + λ) Selection’ for survivor selection. The
            effectiveness of the algorithm was used on different maps, such as
            Western Sahara, Uruguay, and Canada.

            user accounts and allow users to save, edit, and delete notes. These
            notes will be stored in a remote database.

            create a single platform where users can access, edit, and save
            their notes as well as to-do lists. Another future functionality of
            the project will be to add an alert system which will notify users
            about nearing deadlines.

            functionality rather visual aspects of the User Interface. The
            project works to return a few preset database queries but can be
            extended to invoke any database query as needed. The rundown of this
            project and its results can be accessed on GitHub.
